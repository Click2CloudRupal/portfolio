**Project 1** – Automatic Reddit Analyzer and Visualizer

This script connects to Reddit and Google API. Pulls the top 20 hot posts from the AITA subreddit counts the votes and pushes that info to google sheets – where it gets visualized. The script is automatically run every hour in a virtual server from AWS.

Here is the [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSGATLkDaSs9x3OhYfOsgm8Xwic61eXyqG1NZ-Y40QHg4UZlk9L1XikWOVY0QGPi71KlRtVO_eUZUAE/pubchart?oid=1753950542&format=interactive) to the visualization.

**Project 2** – Power BI and Financial Data

Put together a large dataset of financial data and used Power BI to make a presentation.
